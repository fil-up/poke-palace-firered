# State Template

Template for `.planning/STATE.md` — the project's living memory.

```markdown
# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated [date])

**Core value:** [One-liner from PROJECT.md Core Value section]
**Current focus:** [Current phase name]

## Current Position

Phase: [X] of [Y] ([Phase name])
Plan: [A] of [B] in current phase
Status: [Ready to plan / Planning / Ready to execute / In progress / Phase complete]
Last activity: [YYYY-MM-DD] — [What happened]

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: [N]
- Average duration: [X] min
- Total execution time: [X.X] hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase X]: [Decision summary]
- [Phase Y]: [Decision summary]

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

None yet.

## Session Continuity

Last session: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
Stopped at: [Description of last completed action]
Resume file: [Path to .continue-here if exists, else "None"]
```

## Purpose

STATE.md is the project's short-term memory spanning all phases and sessions.

**Problem it solves:** Information is captured in summaries but not systematically consumed. Sessions start without context.

**Solution:** A single, small file that's:
- Read first in every workflow
- Updated after every significant action
- Contains digest of accumulated context
- Enables instant session restoration

## Lifecycle

**Creation:** After ROADMAP.md is created
**Reading:** First step of every workflow
**Writing:** After every significant action

## Size Constraint

Keep STATE.md under 100 lines.

It's a DIGEST, not an archive. If accumulated context grows too large:
- Keep only 3-5 recent decisions
- Keep only active blockers

The goal is "read once, know where we are"
