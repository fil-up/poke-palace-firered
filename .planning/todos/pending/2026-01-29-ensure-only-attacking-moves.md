title: Ensure only attacking moves

## Problem

The current move pool still includes non-attacking behavior (status moves, secondary effects, multi-turn, counter, terrain, Destiny Bond, etc.), which violates the "damage-only" rules.

## Solution

TBD — identify and remove or block all non-damaging moves/effects across move data and battle logic so only direct damaging moves remain.
